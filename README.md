This is a website bot

This code logs in to the website, scans and tries to pick jobs, for a certain amount of time.
When a job is picked, the code is paused by accepting an input, which allows you to work on the Job.
if a job is not picked succesifully, the code repeats the process till the normal url != to the job url.
The code has been tested, it works but it isn't fast enough.
